# Quantitative Trading System & Portfolio Optimizer

An end-to-end algorithmic trading and portfolio optimization engine built in Python. This system downloads live market data, generates vectorised technical trading signals, executes a historically accurate backtest, attributes performance using the **Fama-French 3-Factor Model**, and optimizes capital allocation using **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization** and the **Black-Litterman Model**.

**Live Dashboard Application included.**

---

## 📈 Key Features

1. **Vectorised Backtesting Engine (`src/backtest/engine.py`)**
   - High-performance, Pandas-native backtesting architecture.
   - Built-in prevention of lookahead bias (Signal generated on T-Close, Position entered at T+1 Open).
   - Accurately models transaction costs (slippage/commission).

2. **Trend Following & Mean Reversion Signals (`src/signals/generator.py`)**
   - **Main Strategy:** EMA Golden/Death Cross combined with RSI overbought/oversold filtering.
   - Outputs discrete `+1` (Long) and `-1` (Short) signals across multiple assets.

3. **Fama-French 3-Factor Attribution (`src/factors/fama_french.py`)**
   - Decomposes strategy returns via OLS regression with HC3 robust standard errors.
   - Identifies genuine skill (Alpha, $\alpha$) versus systematic exposure to Market, Size (SMB), and Value (HML) factors.

4. **Advanced Portfolio Optimization (`src/portfolio/markowitz.py` & `black_litterman.py`)**
   - **Markowitz MVO:** Extracts the Efficient Frontier and Tangency Portfolio using Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage to regularize the covariance matrix (reducing estimation error).
   - **Black-Litterman Model:** Overcomes Markowitz's "error-maximizing" problem by blending market-implied prior returns with subjective investor views using Bayesian updating, yielding highly stable and tradable weights.

5. **Out-Of-Sample (OOS) Walk-Forward Testing**
   - In-Sample Training (2018–2022) for weight optimization.
   - Out-of-Sample Testing (2023–2024) to prove robustness against overfitting and data leakage.

6. **Live Execution Hook (`run_live.py`)**
   - Command-line script leveraging `yfinance` to fetch real-time market data and generate actionable, day-of trading signals.

## 📊 Streamlit Dashboard

The project includes an interactive web application allowing users to visualize equity curves, Fama-French metrics, and Black-Litterman allocations without interacting with code.

### Running Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algo-trading-system.git
cd algo-trading-system

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```
*(Alternatively, you can double-click `run_dashboard.bat` on Windows)*

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🧠 The Math: Black-Litterman Explained

While Markowitz Optimization is mathematically elegant, it is highly sensitive to the expected returns ($\mu$) inputted. 

This system implements **Black-Litterman** to solve this. It assumes the market portfolio is efficient, reverses the optimization to find the **Market-Implied Prior Returns** ($\Pi$), and updates them using the investor's subjective views ($Q$) and a confidence matrix ($\Omega$).

$$ E[R] = [(\tau \Sigma)^{-1} + P^T \Omega^{-1} P]^{-1} [(\tau \Sigma)^{-1} \Pi + P^T \Omega^{-1} Q] $$

The result is a posterior distribution of returns that leads to far more stable, intuitive, and less "cornered" portfolio weights than pure historical MVO.
